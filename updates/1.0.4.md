__New Configuration Options:__

1. All the camera views have been implemented on every location on the configuration file, if you want to add them manually, search for `CameraViews` on every location and copy-paste them (They are on every location - Horses section) and it looks like this:

```lua
			CameraViews = {
				['SADDLE'] = false, -- SET TO FALSE IF CAMERA VIEW IS OKAY WITHOUT ADJUSTING.
				['BAG']    = { x = -368.525,  y = 791.6607,  z = 116.80,  rotx = -15.0, roty = 0.0, rotz = 87.435729980, fov = 60.0},
				['TAIL']   = { x = -370.590,  y = 793.6685,  z = 117.0,  rotx = -15.0, roty = 0.0, rotz = 217.467391, fov = 50.0},
				['MASK']   = false, -- SET TO FALSE IF CAMERA VIEW IS OKAY WITHOUT ADJUSTING.
				['BEDROLL'] = { x = -368.525,  y = 791.6607,  z = 116.80,  rotx = -15.0, roty = 0.0, rotz = 87.435729980, fov = 60.0}, -- SET TO FALSE IF CAMERA VIEW IS OKAY WITHOUT ADJUSTING.
				['BLANKET'] = { x = -370.590,  y = 793.6685,  z = 117.0,  rotx = -15.0, roty = 0.0, rotz = 217.467391, fov = 50.0},
				['MANE'] = false, -- SET TO FALSE IF CAMERA VIEW IS OKAY WITHOUT ADJUSTING.
				['MUSTACHE'] = false, -- SET TO FALSE IF CAMERA VIEW IS OKAY WITHOUT ADJUSTING.
				['HORN'] = false, -- SET TO FALSE IF CAMERA VIEW IS OKAY WITHOUT ADJUSTING.
				['STIRRUP'] = false, -- SET TO FALSE IF CAMERA VIEW IS OKAY WITHOUT ADJUSTING.
				['BRIDLE'] = false, -- SET TO FALSE IF CAMERA VIEW IS OKAY WITHOUT ADJUSTING.
				['LANTERN'] = false, -- SET TO FALSE IF CAMERA VIEW IS OKAY WITHOUT ADJUSTING.
				['HOLSTER'] = {x = -368.533, y = 791.0273,  z = 116.80,  rotx = -15.0, roty = 0.0, rotz = 87.435729980, fov = 60.0},
			},
```

2. Add the following configuration option below `Config.TamingPromptActions`.

```lua
Config.HorseLeadingPrompts = {

	['DRINK'] = { Key = 'G',    Label = 'Drink' }, -- drinking from water sources
	['REST']  = { Key = 'DOWN', Label = 'Rest' }, -- resting in ground.
	['WALLOW']  = { Key = 'RIGHT', Label = 'Wallow' }, -- wallow
	['STOP_LEADING']  = { Key = 'F', Label = 'Stop Leading' }, -- stop leading horse
}
```
3. Add the following configuration option below `Config.Ageing`.

```lua
Config.HorseLedActions = {

	['WALLOW'] = { duration = 10, stamina = 0, health = 0 },
	['REST']   = { duration = 30, stamina = 0, health = 0 },

	['DRINK']  = { duration = 10, stamina = 0, health = 0 },
}
```

__New Locale (`locales.lua`):__

```lua
['HORSE_NO_WATER_SOURCE'] = "The horse is not standing on any water source.",
```
